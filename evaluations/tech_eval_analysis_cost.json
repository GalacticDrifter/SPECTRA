To develop standards, detailed cost information is available, as is learning curve data. Ask if standards are being developed/used/current? By what method they were developed? Are they from similar efforts? What efforts control variance and what is the variance? Is this the most appropriate method for forecasting the costs? Review the RF pool and base and underlying data to develop a range of appropriate costs. Remove scrap/rework. Challenge those with differing production states, product maturity, complexity, technological development, etc."
